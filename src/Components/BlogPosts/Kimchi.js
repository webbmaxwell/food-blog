            <h3>Adventures in Kimchi</h3>
            <p>I experimented with <strong>kimchi</strong> for the first time this week!</p>
            <p>If you aren't aware, kimchi is Korean pickled/fermented vegetables, most often cabbage. It's sort of like a spicy sauerkraut.</p>
            <p>I was introduced to the idea of kimchi a number of years ago during the Card Wars episode of Adventure Time, but never knew how I might use it or even where I might buy some.</p>
            <p>Since I've been experimenting with a number of different foods and recipes lately, I thought it would be a good time to give it a shot. I was making potstickers for myself and the girls (though I should say "preparing" since I haven't yet been brave enough to try to make them from scratch yet) and set some kimchi on the plate as a side. Even though I was the only one who had any, I really enjoyed it! The bright, sour, fermented flavor contrasted nicely with the sweet sauce and complimented the umami in the potstickers. </p>
