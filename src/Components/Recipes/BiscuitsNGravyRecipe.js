            <h3>Grandma Mary's Biscuits and Gravy</h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 450Â°</p>
            <p>2 cups of all-purpose flour</p>
            <p>1 tablespoon of baking powder</p>
            <p>2 teaspoons of sugar</p>
            <p>1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar</p>
            <p>1/4 teaspoon of salt</p>
            <p>1/2 cup of butter</p>
            <p>2/3 cup of milk</p>
            <p>Stir flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Soften the butter and cut it in until its course. Put a hole in the center at the mixture add milk all at once. Stir until the dough clings together. Roll it out and use a cup or a biscuit cutter to cut out. Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes until lightly brown. Makes about 10.</p>
            <p>I've made them with and without cream of tartar. They might be a little fluffier with, but if you don't have any that's fine. Double the recipe if there's a bunch of you. Enjoy!!</p>
